# AT_JS_HT3
**Testing Dropbox API with Postman PLUS Jenkins file**

This project was created in order to provide functional test automation of 3 scenarios (below) for [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation).

### HT Sources
Here you can find sources which are requested in the task

* GitHub repo: ooops, actually you're already here ðŸ™ƒ

* [Postman collection link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/1090c70eaed21acf3b54). **Note!** There's no secret credentionals, they're assigned as env variables.

## Scenarios

* #1 scenario - Upload a file:

Scenario:

1. Upload the file (max size - 150MB) with POST request to `https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload`
2. Check the response status is 200 and the path from the request and the response are the same
3. Save a file hash in the collection variables from the response

* #2 scenario - Get metadata of a file:
**precondition: script must authorize in the site with the credentials specified in the collection variables, file hash of the uploaded file is saved (i.e. in collection variables), the path to the file is defined (i.e. in collection variables).**

Scenario:
